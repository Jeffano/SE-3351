# Issues to Address in the Bank Account System Code

## 1. Naming Conventions
The class and variable names are not descriptive and do not follow standard naming conventions. For instance:
- The class name `a` should be `BankAccount`.
- The variable `n` should be `name`.
- The variable `b` should be `balance`.

## 2. Function Names
Function names are unclear and do not provide context about their functionalities. They should be renamed to something more descriptive:
- The function `d` should be `deposit`.
- The function `w` should be `withdraw`.
- The function `db` should be `display_balance`.
- The function `t` should be `transfer`.

## 3. Magic Numbers
The code uses certain numbers like `0` and `1` which act as return values. These should either be replaced with more descriptive constants or proper error handling mechanisms.

## 4. Lack of Comments
The code does not have any comments explaining the logic, purpose of functions, or clarifying complex sections. Comments can provide context and make the code more maintainable.

## 5. Error Handling
Currently, the code uses return values like `1` and `0` to indicate success or failure. However, this approach lacks proper error handling, messaging, and can be confusing. Introducing proper error messages or exceptions can help in understanding the cause of failures.
